# Data directory

This folder is intentionally kept **empty** in the repository to avoid distributing large or restricted datasets.
For DREAM5 evaluation, place files as follows:

- `SPSID/data/dream5/Gold_Standard/` → DREAM5 gold-standard edge lists
- `SPSID/data/dream5/GRN_Network/`   → inferred networks from GRN methods

You may add other subfolders (e.g., `SPSID/data/simulation/`) as needed. Empty directories are tracked via `.gitkeep`.
